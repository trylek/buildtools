    <!-- This is the standard publish target. It can be used to publish assets for the intermediate output of individual build legs and
         the finalized output of an official build. 
         ExpectedFeedUrl - The url of the nuget feed you would like to generate (should contain the storage account, container and relative path) and end with index.json
         AccountKey - The access key from your Azure storage account 
         ItemsToPush - items to publish to feed
         
         Optional parameters:
         IndexDirectory - the directory in which the temporary index.json files live
         PublishFlatContainer - push without generating the feed useful for flat assets like installers
         Overwrite - Allow overwrite, will skip if file already exists when false

        PublishDependsOn can be customized at build time on the commandline to determine the pre steps required to publish
